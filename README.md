# Social-Economic Impact on Education
It has been theorized for years that students that have a social and economic advantage will do better academically than students that do not have advantages.
We wanted to review how socio-economic advantages might impact standardized test scores in the high school population.
# Questions we had ask ourselves
- Does economic and social advantages give students an advantage when it comes to academics?
- If there is a difference, in exam scores, could the difference be explained by race, gender or other factors?
- How does one define social and economic adavantage?
- Can we state with 95% confidence that "advantaged" students outperform their "non-advantged counterparts?"
# Methodology Used to Test the Hypothesis
We set the null hypothesis to equal each other

- Advantaged Students should have the same exam score as Non-Advantaged Students.
- If we have a P-Value of greater than 0.05,then we will accept the null hypothsis that the exam scores of advantaged students and non-advantaged students are equal to each other.
