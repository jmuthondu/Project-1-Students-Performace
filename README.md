# Social-Economic Impact on Education
It has been theorized for years that students that have a social and economic advantage will do better academically than students that do not have advantages.
We wanted to review how socio-economic advantages might impact standardized test scores in the high school population.
## Questions we had ask ourselves
- Does economic and social advantages give students an advantage when it comes to academics?
- If there is a difference, in exam scores, could the difference be explained by race, gender or other factors?
- How does one define social and economic adavantage?
- Can we state with 95% confidence that "advantaged" students outperform their "non-advantged counterparts?"
## Methodology Used to Test the Hypothesis
We set the null hypothesis to equal each other

- Advantaged Students should have the same exam score as Non-Advantaged Students.
- If we have a P-Value of greater than 0.05,then we will accept the null hypothsis that the exam scores of advantaged students and non-advantaged students are equal to each other. If the P-Value is less than 0.05 then we will reject the hypothesis and accept with 95% confidence that the results are not equal to each other.

- The metrics provided from the dataset include:
     - Parent's highest level of education, Gender,Race or Ethnicity.Standard or Reduced/Free Lunch,Exam Preparation Course taken,Writing Exam Score,Reading Exam Score, and Math Exam Score.
     
## Populations Defined
- Given the available data, we set the advantages for high school students to be:
    - Parent's Level of Education being Bachelor's or Master's Degrees.Standard Lunch only and Exam Preparatio Class taken.
    - The rest of the population would be the student population that is not deemed to have a clear social and economic advantage.
    
-  The results would be examined by taking a mean score of the reading,writing and mathematics exam.However,since the data is available, we can take a deeper look into each subject area if needed.
